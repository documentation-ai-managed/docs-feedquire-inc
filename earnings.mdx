## Understanding Task Rewards

Feedquire rewards you for each AI testing task you complete. Tasks typically pay between `$5` and `$14`, depending on complexity, duration, and required expertise. Simple feedback tasks might earn you `$5-7`, while in-depth usability tests or edge-case evaluations pay up to `$14`.

Rewards appear in your dashboard immediately after task approval, usually within 24 hours. Track your earnings via the [Earnings tab](https://dashboard.example.com/earnings) in your account.
